# Minesweeper-webpage
 A take on Minesweeper in a webpage format

## 

Hello. I know it doesn't make sense to see Minesweeper again after the [`tkinter-minesweeper`](https://github.com/Goose-Of-War/tkinter-minesweeper) repository, but that repository was made as a practice batch to refresh how to make Minesweeper and handle the front-end/back-end operations in it.

### What will you be using, Goose?

This time, I'll be using HTML/CSS for front-end and JS for back-end. This project will help me learn a bit about using JS in webpages (which is the main motive for this project). With that set, I guess I'll get started on the work.
