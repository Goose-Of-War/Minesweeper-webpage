# Minesweeper-webpage
 A take on Minesweeper in a webpage format

## 

Hello. I know it doesn't make sense to see Minesweeper again after the [`tkinter-minesweeper`](https://github.com/Goose-Of-War/tkinter-minesweeper) repository, but that repository was made as a practice batch to refresh how to make Minesweeper and handle the front-end/back-end operations in it.

### What will you be using, Goose?

This time, I'll be using HTML/CSS for front-end and JS for back-end. This project will help me learn a bit about using JS in webpages (which is the main motive for this project). With that set, I guess I'll get started on the work.

```

	Coming back with an update after probably an eon, for whoever is keeping track of this :)
	Finally made a button generate a grid on clicking. I wonder why I took an eon for this puny thingy ... actually, I don't. I know why (it's laziness if you didn't get it :!)
	At least now you can expect the pace to be back to normal :)
}
```

Until later
