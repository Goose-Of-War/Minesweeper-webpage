# Minesweeper-webpage
 A take on Minesweeper in a webpage format

## 

Hello. I know it doesn't make sense to see Minesweeper again after the [`tkinter-minesweeper`](https://github.com/Goose-Of-War/tkinter-minesweeper) repository, but that repository was made as a practice batch to refresh how to make Minesweeper and handle the front-end/back-end operations in it.

### What will you be using, Goose?

This time, I'll be using HTML/CSS for front-end and JS for back-end. This project will help me learn a bit about using JS in webpages (which is the main motive for this project). With that set, I guess I'll get started on the work.

So... this repo _did_ get shelved, as I mentioned in my past commit. Welp, anyone seeing this can add their own touch of stuff. I mean, considering that the majority of it is like, cleared, it's kind of safe to say that there isn't much to work on except for the styles and the alerts and... I'll let you think about it (totally not me running out of things I can think of to improve in this repository)

Feel free to fork this repository, edit some stuff and send me a PR (or not, up to you)
